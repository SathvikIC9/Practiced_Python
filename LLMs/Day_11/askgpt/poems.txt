The wind came dancing through the trees,
With stories carried on the breeze.
It whispered songs of stars and streams,
And tucked the night inside my dreams.

The moon looked down with silver eyes,
And painted light across the skies.
The flowers bowed, the grasses swayed,
As time stood still and silence played.

In nature’s arms I found my place,
No need to run, no need to race.
Just breathe the dark, embrace the deep—
Let dreams arise, and gently sleep.
