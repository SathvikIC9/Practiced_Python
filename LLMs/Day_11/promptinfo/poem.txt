In Python's land, where coders dream,
Lives Flask — so light, a gentle stream.
No bulky frame, no tangled mess,
Just routes and views — pure code finesse.

A single file, and there you go,
Your web app starts with just one show.
With @app.route, the path is set,
And logic flows without a sweat.

Need forms or JSON? Flask won’t fuss,
It handles all — no need to cuss.
Extend with blueprints, Jinja too,
A web magician’s trusted glue.

So raise your glass, give Flask a cheer,
For making web dev bright and clear!
